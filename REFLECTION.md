## Identifier Naming Reflection

| Name and Explanation | Reflection and Rules from Clean Code |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `parseDate` <br> Function that parses a date string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' into a Date object. | **Intention-Revealing Names**: The name `parseDate` clearly indicates that the function is responsible for parsing a date. <br> **Use Solution Domain Names**: The term "parse" is commonly used in programming to describe the process of analyzing a string. |
| `addDays` <br> Function that adds a specified number of days to a date. | **Intention-Revealing Names**: The name `addDays` clearly indicates that the function adds days to a date. <br> **Use Pronounceable Names**: The name is easy to pronounce and understand. |
| `createDateFormatter` <br> Function that creates a date formatter. | **Intention-Revealing Names**: The name `createDateFormatter` clearly indicates that the function creates a date formatter. <br> **Avoid Disinformation**: The name accurately describes the function's purpose without being misleading. |
| `dateDifference` <br> Function that calculates the difference in days between two dates. | **Intention-Revealing Names**: The name `dateDifference` clearly indicates that the function calculates the difference between two dates. <br> **Use Problem Domain Names**: The term "difference" is commonly used in the context of comparing dates. |
| `isWeekend` <br> Function that checks if a given date falls on a weekend. | **Intention-Revealing Names**: The name `isWeekend` clearly indicates that the function checks if a date is a weekend. <br> **Use Pronounceable Names**: The name is easy to pronounce and understand. |

### Brief Reflection on Chapter 2 of "Clean Code"

Chapter 2 of "Clean Code" emphasizes the importance of using clear, intention-revealing names for identifiers. This helps other programmers understand the purpose of the code without needing extensive comments. The chapter also advises against using disinformation, making meaningful distinctions, and using pronounceable and searchable names. By following these principles, the code becomes more readable and maintainable.

In my module, I applied these principles by choosing names that clearly describe the purpose of each function. For example, `parseDate`, `addDays`, and `isWeekend` are all names that immediately convey their functionality. This reduces the cognitive load on other programmers who use the module, making it easier for them to understand and integrate the code into their own projects.
